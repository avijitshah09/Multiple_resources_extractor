The Space Ship Under the Apple Tree is a children's science fiction book series by Louis Slobodkin, and also the name of the first book in the series. The books were published by Macmillan.
The series involves a Boy Scout named Eddie who meets an alien in his apple orchard who comes from the planet Martinea. The series humorously depicts their friendship as Eddie tries to explain the strange things that humans do and why.
Eddie also appears as a Cub Scout in an earlier book called Bixxy and the Secret Message (1949).
