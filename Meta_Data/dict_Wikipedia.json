    "article": "Apple Tree (foaled 6 March 1989) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. During a racing career which lasted from September 1991 until October 1995 he competed in France, Germany, England, the United States and Japan, winning seven of his twenty-six races. After showing promise as a two-year-old he won the Prix Greffulhe and the Preis von Europa in 1992. As a four-year-old he ran prominently in several major races before winning the Prix du Prince d'Orange and the Turf Classic. He reached his peak as a five-year-old in 1994 when he defeated top-class international fields in the Coronation Cup and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion with limited success.\nApple Tree is a chestnut horse standing 16.2 hands high with three white socks bred in France by Paul de Moussac. He was sired by Bikala, who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1981 and the Prix Ganay in 1982. The best of his other offspring was probably Polytain whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club. Apple Tree's dam Pomme Rose won the Prix Imprudence in 1971 and produced several other winners including the Prix du Conseil de Paris winner Noir Et Or.\nThe colt was sent into training with Andre Fabre in France and was ridden in most of his races by Thierry Jarnet.\nAfter finishing seventh on his racecourse debut at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in September, Apple Tree recorded his first victory at Compiegne on 10 September. On his third and final appearance as a juvenile he was stepped up in class and finished sixth behind Glaieul in the Group One Criterium de Saint-Cloud.\nOn his three-year-old debut, Apple Tree contested the Prix Greffulhe (a trial race for the Prix du Jockey Club) over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in April and started the 6.9/1 fourth choice behind Cristofori (Prix de Conde), Break Bread (Prix Yacowlef) and Silver Kite. After turning into the straight in fifth place, he took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by two lengths from Break Bread. In the Prix Lupin over the same course and distance in May and finished third behind Johann Quatz and Contested Bid. At Chantilly Racecourse on 7 June he finished seventh of the seventeen runners in the Prix du Jockey Club, seven and a half lengths behind the winner Polytain.\nAfter a three-month break Apple Tree returned in the Prix Niel over 2400 metres at Longchamp in September. He finished third behind Songlines and Petit Loup with Johann Quatz and Polytain unplaced. Two weeks later he was sent to Germany for the Preis von Europa at Cologne in which he was matched against the Prels Der Privatbanklers Merck, Finck & Co winner Platini. After racing in third he took the lead 200 metres from the finish and recorded his first Group One victory as he won by one and three quarter lengths from Platini.\nThe early part of Apple Tree's third season saw him running consistently well in top-class middle distance races without winning. He finished fourth to Marildo in the Prix d'Harcourt, second to Zindabad in the Jockey Club Stakes, second to Modhish in the Prix Jean de Chaudenay, third to Opera House in the Coronation Cup, second to User Friendly in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and seventh behind Monsun in the Aral-Pokal. In September Apple Tree was dropped to Group Three class for the Prix du Prince d'Orange over 2000 metres on soft ground at Longchamp and started odds-on favourite. Racing in blinkers, he took the lead 300 metres from the finish and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from Marildo.\nMike Smith took over from Jarnet when Apple Tree was sent to the United States to contest the Grade I Turf Classic at Belmont Park on 9 October. Shortly before the race he had been bought for an undisclosed sum by Sultan Mohammed al Kabeer. He was made the 4.7/1 third choice in the betting behind the leading North American turf performers Star of Cozzene (Arlington Million) and Fraise (Breeders' Cup Turf). Smith settled Apple Tree in fourth place as Solar Splendour set a slow pace from Fraise and Star of Cozzene. Apple Tree moved up on the outside on the final turn, overtook Solar Slendour well inside the final furlong and won by two and a quarter lengths. Four weeks later, the colt was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park. With Smith again in the saddle he started at odds of 11/1 but started slowly and never looked likely to win, finishing ninth of the fourteen runners behind Kotashaan.\nIn the spring of 1994, Apple Tree finished fourth to Urban Sea in the Prix d'Harcourt and second to Silver Wisp in the Jockey Club Stakes. On 3 June he ran for the second time in the Coronation Cup and started at odds of 12/1 in an eleven-runner field. Intrepidity started favourite whilst the other runners included White Muzzle (runner-up in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), Urban Sea, Royal Ballerina (second in the Irish Oaks), Monsun, Only Royale and Environment Friend. After being restrained towards the rear of the field by Jarnet he switched to the outside in the straight and began to make rapid progress. He overtook Environment Friend inside the final furlong and won \"comfortably\" by a length, with Blush Rambler taking third ahead of Urban Sea and White Muzzle. After the race Jarnet commented \"He's a very genuine horse but he doesn't like being tightened up between other horses and prefers to run his own race\" before adding \"I wasn't here to get revenge, I rode the horse because of his ability\", a reference to his somewhat unlucky defeat on Subotica in the 1992 edition of the races.\nA month after his win at Epsom, Apple Tree started facourite for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud in which he was opposed by Muhtarram, Bright Moon (Prix Minerve, Prix de Pomone, Grand Prix d'Evry), Marchand de Sable (Criterium de Saint-Cloud), Kornado (Prels Der Privatbanklers Merck, Finck & Co) and Marildo. He raced towards the rear of the field before producing a strong late run to catch Muhtarram in the final strides and won by head to claim his second consecutive Group One victory. Apple Tree then started 5/1 third favourite for the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse but finished fourth in a very rough race won by King's Theatre.\nAter a brief summer break, Apple Tree returned in the Prix Foy (a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Trimomphe) at Longchamp in September in which he finished third behind Richard of York and Intrepidity with the odds-on favourite Hernando in fourth. In the 1994 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe Apple Tree was ridden by John Reid and started at odds of 14/1 in a twenty-runner field. He turned into the straight in seventh place, and recovered after struggling to obtain a clear run to join the leaders in the final furlong. In a \"blanket finish\" he took third place, beaten a short neck and half a length by Carnegie and Hernando. On his final start for Fabre, Apple Tree was sent to Tokyo Racecourse for the Japan Cup on 27 November but finished unplaced behind Marvelous Crown.\nIn 1995 Apple Tree was transferred to race in North America where he was trained by Bill Mott. He made only one appearance for his new trainer, finishing ninth in a Grade III race at Meadowlands Racetrack in October.\nAt the end of his racing career Apple Tree was retired to stud. After standing for several years at the French National Stud he moved to the Beech Tree Stud in Somerset in 2009. He has had little success as a sire of winners of flat races but has sired some good National Hunt horses including Lough Derg whose win included the Long Walk Hurdle. As of 2015, he was standing a fee of \u00a31,500.",

    "article": "White Apple Tree (Lithuanian: Baltoji obelis) is a painting by the Lithuanian artist Antanas Samuolis from 1932.\nThe picture is painted in oil on canvas and has dimensions of 89 x 71\u00a0cm.\nThe picture is part of the collection of the Lithuanian Art Museum in Vilnius.\nWhite apple tree holds a special place in the history of Lithuanian art as part of the best landscapes. Presented for the first time in 1932. Though young at the time, Antanas Samuolis showed maturity in his work. The main focus of the picture is aimed at apple tree that is central to it, highlighted by its lighter color. The woman bent over a barrel, a dog and several buildings are of secondary importance in the picture. Expressionism is represented by crooked trunk of the tree, hunched woman and uneven plowed farmland. The scene, which is presented contains the poetic mood of loneliness and sadness. The scenery is authentic, it is assumed that the apple tree is in the family garden of the artist. The picture contains autobiographical aspect, alluding to the hard life of the artist, suffering from ill health and financial difficulties.",

    "article": "Jesus Christ the Apple Tree (also known as Apple Tree and, in its early publications, as Christ Compared to an Apple-tree) is a poem, presumably intended for use as a carol, written by an unknown person in the 18th century. It has been set to music by a number of composers, including Jeremiah Ingalls (1764\u20131838) and Elizabeth Poston (1905\u20131987).\nThe first known publication of \"Jesus Christ the Apple Tree\" was in London's Spiritual Magazine in August, 1761. This credits \"R.H.\" as the submitter and presumed author. Another early printing, which cannot be dated closely but may well be the second and could even be earlier, is an English broadsheet. This broadsheet uses the term \"Methodists,\" which certainly places it after about 1730, when the term first came into use at Oxford University, and probably substantially later, when the religious movement had spread.\nThe hymn's first known appearance in a hymnal, and in America, was in 1784 in Divine Hymns, or Spiritual Songs: for the use of Religious Assemblies and Private Christians compiled by Joshua Smith, a lay Baptist minister from New Hampshire. It became quite common in American hymnbooks, though not in English ones, after that, and for that reason has often been assumed to have an American author; there is no evidence however to support this.\nThe song may be an allusion to both the apple tree in Song of Solomon 2:3 which has been interpreted as a metaphor representing Christ, and to Jesus' description of his life as a tree of life in Luke 13:18\u201319 and elsewhere in the New Testament including Revelation 22:1\u20132 and within the Old Testament in Genesis. Apple trees were commonly grown in early New England and there was an old English tradition of wassailing or wishing health to apple trees on Christmas Eve. The song is now performed by choirs around the world, especially during the Christmas season as a Christmas carol.\nAnother motivation of the song may have been to Christianize old English winter season songs used in wassailing the apple orchards \u2014 pouring out libations or engaging in similar ceremonies to seek fertility of the trees.",

    "article": "The apple tree (Malus pumila, commonly and erroneously called Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.\nApple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally apple cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\nWorldwide production of apples in 2014 was 84.6 million tonnes, with China accounting for 48% of the total.\nThe apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 1.8 to 4.6\u00a0m (6 to 15\u00a0ft) tall in cultivation and up to 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.\nBlossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves, and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4\u00a0cm (1.2 to 1.6\u00a0in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4\u20136 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the \"king bloom\"; it opens first, and can develop a larger fruit.\nThe fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist with a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7.0 to 8.3\u00a0cm (2.75 to 3.25\u00a0in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.7\u00a0cm (2.25\u00a0in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted although many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found. The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax. The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink or yellow exocarps also occur.\nThe original wild ancestor of Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.\nIn 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had sequenced the complete genome of the apple in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple\u2014an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.\nThe center of diversity of the genus Malus is in eastern present-day Turkey. The apple tree was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated, and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. Alexander the Great is credited with finding dwarfed apples in Kazakhstan in 328 BCE; those he brought back to Macedonia might have been the progenitors of dwarfing root stocks. Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.\nApples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century, and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625. The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called \"common apples\". Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the \"best\" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century. In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.\nUntil the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage. In the 21st century, long-term storage again came into popularity, as \"controlled atmosphere\" facilities were used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness.\nIn Norse mythology, the goddess I\u00f0unn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful Ger\u00f0r by Sk\u00edrnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the V\u00f6lsunga saga when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound. Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the Caesarean section birth of their son\u2014the hero V\u00f6lsung.\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of Hel\" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of I\u00f0unn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"\nApples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word \"apple\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century. For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.\nThe Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 (Kalliste, sometimes transliterated Kallisti, 'For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.\nThe apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, to be sacred to Aphrodite, and to throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:\nAtalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon the Greek word for both \"apple\" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.\nThough the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her. The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words m\u0101lum (an apple) and m\u0103lum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum. The tree of the forbidden fruit is called \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" in Genesis 2:17, and the Latin for \"good and evil\" is bonum et malum.\nRenaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the \"Adam's apple\" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.\nThere are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent. The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.\nThe UK's national fruit collection database contains a wealth of information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same 'genetic' apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.\nCommercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desired qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor. Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia and especially Indian Subcontinent .\nOld cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and have a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have a better flavor than modern cultivars, but they may have other problems which make them commercially unviable\u2014low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the 'wrong' size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.\nIn the wild, apples grow readily from seeds. However, like most perennial fruits, apples are ordinarily propagated asexually by grafting. This is because seedling apples are an example of \"extreme heterozygotes\", in that rather than inheriting DNA from their parents to create a new apple with those characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents. Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.\nBecause apples do not breed true when planted as seeds, grafting is generally used to produce new apple trees. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) high at maturity), which bear fruit earlier in their life cycle than full size trees. Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BC, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century, and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world. The majority of the rootstocks used today to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an \"M\" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an \"MM\" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.\nMost new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics. The words 'seedling', 'pippin', and 'kernel' in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.\nSince the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.\nApples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.\nApples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.\nThere are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:\nOne cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).\nCultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period.\nCultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, will grow very large, which allows them to bear much more fruit, but makes harvesting very difficult. Depending on the tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40\u2013200\u00a0kg (88\u2013441\u00a0lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks will bear about 10\u201380\u00a0kg (22\u2013176\u00a0lb) of fruit per year.\nCrops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', 'Sweet Bough', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', 'Swayzie', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'.\nCommercially, apples can be stored for some months in controlled-atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage. For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5\u00a0\u00b0C). Some, including 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji', can be stored up to a year without significant degradation.\nApple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods.[citation needed] These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.\nA wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant; three of the more common diseases/pests are mildew, aphids and apple scab.\nAmong the most serious disease problems are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.\nWorld production of apples in 2014 was 84.6 million tonnes, with China producing 48% of this total (table). Other major producers with 6% or less of the world total were the United States, Turkey, Poland and Italy.\nA typical apple serving weighs 242 grams and provides 126 calories with a moderate content of dietary fiber (table). Otherwise, there is generally low content of essential nutrients (table).\nApples are often eaten raw. The whole fruit including the skin is suitable for human consumption except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers.[citation needed] The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.\nApples can be canned or juiced. They are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered. The juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar. Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein. Apple seed oil and pectin may also be produced.\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.\nSliced apples turn brown with exposure to air due to the conversion of natural phenolic substances into melanin upon exposure to oxygen. Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after slicing and the genetically engineered Arctic Apples do not brown. Sliced fruit can be treated with acidulated water to prevent this effect. Sliced apple consumption tripled in the US from 2004 to 2014 to 500 million apples annually due to its convenience.\nOrganic apples are commonly produced in the United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.\nApples are a rich source of various phytochemicals including flavonoids (e.g., catechins, flavanols, and quercetin) and other phenolic compounds (e.g., epicatechin and procyanidins) found in the skin, core, and pulp of the apple; they have unknown health value in humans.\nIdeain (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside) is an anthocyanin, a type of pigment, which is found in some red apple cultivars.\nPhlorizin is a flavonoid that is found in apple trees, particularly in the leaves, and in only small amounts if at all in other plants, even other species of the Malus genus or related plants such as pear trees.\nPreliminary research is investigating whether nutrients and/or phytochemicals in apples may affect the risk of some types of cancer.\nOne form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed\u2014the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.\nIn other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.\nBreeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.\nThe seeds of apples contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. There are no case reports of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds as recorded in the Hazardous Substances Data Bank of the United States National Library of Medicine.\nThe proverb \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\", addressing the health effects of the fruit, dates from 19th century Wales, according to Caroline Taggart, author of \u201cAn Apple a Day: Old-Fashioned Proverbs and Why They Still Work\u201d. The original phrase, Taggart said, was: \"Eat an apple on going to bed, and you\u2019ll keep the doctor from earning his bread\". In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to \u201can apple a day, no doctor to pay\u201d and \u201can apple a days sends the doctor away\u201d, while the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.",

    "article": "Malus ( or ) is a genus of about 30\u201355 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae, including the domesticated orchard apple (M. pumila). The other species are generally known as crabapples, crab apples, crabs, or wild apples.\nThe genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.\nApple trees are typically 4\u201312\u00a0m (13\u201339\u00a0ft) tall at maturity, with a dense, twiggy crown. The leaves are 3\u201310\u00a0cm (1.2\u20133.9\u00a0in) long, alternate, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are borne in corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, and are perfect, with usually red stamens that produce copious pollen, and a half-inferior ovary; flowering occurs in the spring after 50\u201380 growing degree days (varying greatly according to subspecies and cultivar).\nApples require cross-pollination between individuals by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen); all are self-sterile, and (with the exception of a few specially developed cultivars) self-pollination is impossible, making pollinating insects essential. Several Malus species, including domestic apples, hybridize freely. They are used as food plants by the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus.\nThe fruit is a globose pome, varying in size from 1\u20134\u00a0cm (0.39\u20131.57\u00a0in) diameter in most of the wild species, to 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) in M. sylvestris sieversii, 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in M. domestica, and even larger in certain cultivated orchard apples. The centre of the fruit contains five carpels arranged star-like, each containing one or two seeds.\nFor the Malus pumila cultivars, the cultivated apples, see Apple.\nCrabapples are popular as compact ornamental trees, providing blossom in Spring and colourful fruit in Autumn. The fruits often persist throughout Winter. Numerous hybrid cultivars have been selected, of which 'Evereste' and 'Red Sentinel' have gained The Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nOther varieties are dealt with under their species names.\nSome crabapples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to add beneficial characteristics. For example, varieties of Baccata, also called Siberian crab, rootstock is used to give additional cold hardiness to the combined plant for orchards in cold northern areas.\nThey are also used as pollinizers in apple orchards. Varieties of crabapple are selected to bloom contemporaneously with the apple variety in an orchard planting, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. In emergencies, a bucket or drum bouquet of crabapple flowering branches are placed near the beehives as orchard pollenizers. See also Fruit tree pollination.\nCrabapples are small and sour tasting, and visually resemble a small apple, particularly some apples known as the \"Lady Apple\", which is also known as Pomme d'Api, Lady's Finger, Wax Apple and Christmas Apple.\nCrabapple fruit is not an important crop in most areas, being extremely sour due to malic acid (which like the genus derives from the Latin name m\u0101lum), and in some species woody, and for this reason is rarely eaten raw. In some southeast Asian cultures they are valued as a sour condiment, sometimes eaten with salt and chili pepper, or shrimp paste.[citation needed]\nSome crabapple varieties are an exception to the reputation of being sour, and can be very sweet, such as the 'Chestnut' cultivar.\nCrabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured preserve with a full, spicy flavour. A small percentage of crabapples in cider makes a more interesting flavour. As Old English Wergulu, the crab apple is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century.\nApple wood gives off a pleasant scent when burned, and smoke from an apple wood fire gives an excellent flavour to smoked foods. It is easier to cut when green; dry apple wood is exceedingly difficult to carve by hand. It is a good wood for cooking fires because it burns hot and slow, without producing much flame.\nBecause of the plentiful blossoms and small fruit, crabapples are popular for use in bonsai culture.",

    "article": "The Apple Tree is a series of three musical playlets with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and a book by Bock and Harnick with contributions from Jerome Coopersmith. Each act has its own storyline, but all three are tied together by a common theme (someone who believes that they want something, but once they get what they wanted they realize that it wasn't what they wanted) and common references, such as references to the color brown. The first act is based on Mark Twain's The Diary of Adam and Eve; the second act is based on Frank R. Stockton's The Lady or the Tiger?; the third act is based on Jules Feiffer's Passionella. The working title for the evening of three musicals was Come Back! Go Away! I Love You!\nThe musical opened on Broadway on October 18, 1966 at the Shubert Theatre and ran for 463 performances, closing on November 25, 1967. It was produced by Stuart Ostrow, directed by Mike Nichols and starred Barbara Harris, Alan Alda, and Larry Blyden. Harris won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The Apple Tree also received several other major Tony nominations: Bock and Harnick for Best Composer and Lyricist, Nichols for Best Direction of a Musical, Lee Theodore for Best Choreography, and the show itself for Best Musical.\nThe Encores! staged concert production ran from May 12, 2005 through May 16, 2005, and starred Kristin Chenoweth, Malcolm Gets and Michael Cerveris.\nThe Roundabout Theatre Company mounted a revival that ran from December 14, 2006 until March 11, 2007 with Kristin Chenoweth in Harris' roles, Brian D'Arcy James in Alda's roles and Marc Kudisch in Blyden's. The consensus of reviews was that the playlets themselves are all creaky with age, the music interesting but not inspired, and Chenoweth's performance a marvel and the evening's only important attraction. It ran for 18 previews and 99 regular shows for a total of 117 performances.\nIn the first story, Adam awakes to find that he is required to name all of the animals. He names them simply: flyers, swimmers and crawlers. He enjoys being the \"sole and single man\" on Earth. Then, he meets Eve, the \"long haired creature\", in the garden. Eve greatly enjoys her time \"Here in Eden\", and begins to name everything with more detailed names: cows, ducks, horses, etc. Adam becomes annoyed with Eve and she hurts his feelings when he discovers that she thinks she is superior to him. Eve doesn't think that Adam appreciates her and he makes her feel put out, but she begins to have some \"Feelings\" for him. Adam builds a shelter for himself, but when he sees Eve sitting in the rain he invites her in, where she immediately begins redecorating which Adam hates. Although Adam is annoyed, he too begins to have Feelings for \"Eve.\" The two get into another argument, this time about cutting the grass around their house. After the fight, Adam storms away and Eve decides to go to a pond, where she thinks her reflection is someone just like her and that they are best \"Friends\". Soon, a snake appears. It seems to know everything, and tells Eve that she can know everything, too, as long as she eats the apples from the tree over the hill - the tree that Adam told her was forbidden. The snake tells her that Adam is wrong and that the apples are not \"Forbidden Fruit\". She eats an apple, but suddenly Adam realizes that something has happened to his \"Beautiful, Beautiful World\". Once the couple is out of Eden, they become closer. They now need each other more and have come to tolerate each other's weaknesses. Soon, Eve has their first child, Cain, but Adam thinks that \"It's a Fish\". Eve sings the baby a \"Lullaby\", and soon they have another son, Abel. After the boys grow up, Cain kills Abel and Eve reflects on her life, including her feelings for Adam. She tells Adam that she wants the two of them to die together, or at least have her die first because she needs him more than he needs her (to which he protests). She then reflects on \"What Makes Me Love Him\". Eve dies and Adam, who always hated flowers, begins to water her garden, because she loved the flowers so much.\nThe second story takes place in a somewhat barbaric kingdom. The story, told by a balladeer, is about love and jealousy (\"I'll Tell You a Truth\"). He introduces King Arik and his daughter Princess Barbara entering a great banquet that is being held (\"Make Way\"). They show a traditional trial: the prisoner is put into a large arena with two doors. Behind one door is a beautiful woman - if the prisoner chooses that door, he is innocent and is required to marry the woman. Behind the other door is a ravenous tiger. If the prisoner chooses that door, he is deemed guilty and the tiger will kill him. After the trial, the King's Captain Sanjar returns from a long battle that they have won. The captain collapses, but the King and his court leave him there and decide to celebrate. A slave, Nadjira, stays behind to comfort him, but Princess Barbara comes back and orders that she leave. It is then discovered that Barbara and Sanjar are in love, but that because of class no one can know. They discuss their \"Forbidden Love\" and consider running away to Gaul. They realize that their place is here, and while they are stealing a kiss, King Arik walks in and catches them. Arik sentences Sanjar to a trial, much to Barbara's dismay. She decides to find out which door the tiger is behind so that Sanjar is not slaughtered. She asks the Royal Tiger Keeper (who is also the balladeer) to tell her which door hides the tiger. He tells her, but first warns her about having the information. She sings to herself, \"I've Got What You Want\", until she sees Nadjira being led to the arena to hide behind the other door. Barbara had forgotten about this door, but she now realizes that he will have to marry Nadjira if he doesn't chose the other door (\"Tiger, Tiger\"). King Arik, Princess Barbara and their court entourage enter the arena (\"Make Way (reprise)\") and the court contemplates \"Which Door\" Sanjar will choose. Sanjar begs Barbara to tell him which door to choose, and hesitating, she points to a door. The balladeer reenters and sings about the pains of jealousy (\"I'll Tell You a Truth (reprise)\". Which door Barbara chooses for Sanjar is not revealed.\nA Narrator tells of Ella, who sings about the perils of being a chimney sweep and how great it would be to be famous (\"Oh, to be a Movie Star\"). One day, Ella comes home to find that her television is not working. Suddenly her Friendly Neighborhood Godmother (also the narrator) appears and grants her \"her most cherished wish.\" Instantly, Ella becomes \"Gorgeous\", however she can only be Passionella from the seven o'clock news until the end of the late late show (7 P.M. until 4 A.M.). She then leaves her house (\"Who is She?\") A producer signs her to a lifetime contract, and she instantly becomes a star. Men love her and women wish to be exactly like her, and she knows exactly how they feel (\"I Know\"). Ella is still sad, though. She has fame, beauty and \"Wealth\", but she wants love. She meets Flip, a famous singer who is also a hippie, and falls in love with him, but he rejects her, telling her \"You Are Not Real\". Because of this, Passionella goes to her producer and tells him that she will retire unless she can play a chimney sweep in her next movie. He agrees, and Passionella wins the Academy Award for her role. Flip presents the award to her, and he realizes that he loves her and proposes marriage. The couple makes love in front of the television, but they lose track of time, and suddenly it is 4 A.M. Passionella is now Ella, but Flip is no longer Flip, either - he is George L. Brown. They get to know each other's true self and live happily ever after.",

    "article": "Apple Tree Creek War Memorial is a heritage-listed memorial at Bruce Highway, Apple Tree Creek, Bundaberg Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed and built in 1921 by Andrew Lang Petrie. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.\nThe Apple Tree Creek War Memorial was unveiled on 20 March 1921. It was designed and produced by Andrew Lang Petrie of Toowong, Brisbane at a cost of \u00a3230. The stone memorial honours the 77 local men who served during the First World War, including the 15 who died.\nApple Tree Creek developed as a farming community in the 1870s and 80s. The Central Sugar Mill opened in 1895 boosting the economy of the district and by the outbreak of the First World War there were fifty farmers registered in the Post Office Directory, a school, hotel, and store. The 77 men who volunteered from this district represented a substantial proportion of their generation and a movement to commemorate their participation began in 1917.\nPrior to the erection of war memorials, Queensland had little public sculpture and there were few statues or monuments of note even in Brisbane. Although Queensland did send a contingent of men to South Africa during the Boer War (1899 - 1902) memorials to soldiers who served in this war are uncommon. Australia's participation in the First World War (1914 - 1918) however, had an immense impact on the population. The national loss was 60,000 dead and 152,000 wounded from a population of approximately 5 million. Almost 1 in 5 men who went to fight died and their bodies were not returned for burial. The battles were fought in countries far from Australia and even after the war visiting cemeteries in the countries where Australians fought was not possible for most families. The impetus for the creation of memorials as an expression of public mourning was therefore very strong and they became a focus for an outpouring of grief.\nAs substitute war graves they became symbols of remembrance which were treated with reverence and respect. The prominent siting of war memorials and the materials, designs and symbolism used in their construction were meant to honour those who served, ensure lasting remembrance of the dead and draw the attention of the \"rising generation\" to their noble example. The memorials also served as an acknowledgment of what was seen as a coming of age for Australia as a nation and memorials honour those who died as having made \"the supreme sacrifice \" for the good of nation and empire. As memorials were funded by the community, they are true public expression of both grief and national pride and were erected in almost every community. No war since has triggered this kind of response; the dead of World War Two being commemorated largely by adding their names to World War One memorials or by dedicating practical projects to their memory.\nThe Apple Tree Creek memorial was funded by public subscription and prominently positioned in the local recreation reserve. This not only provided an attractive setting, but was a community gathering place and was sited opposite the local school. It was unveiled on 20 March 1921 and was originally crowned with a \"digger\" statue. Although not highly regarded by artists or architects, this design was the popular choice of Queensland communities, perhaps seeming more personal to families and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were imported. They varied slightly in design, presumably to suit the needs of the communities who commissioned them. Originally a captured gun or \"war trophy\" contributed to the setting; however, this has now gone. The pedestal of the memorial is a standard A L Petrie design, first used in 1918 at Ebbw Vale.\nAndrew Lang Petrie was the grandson of Andrew Petrie, an early colonist of Queensland and a prominent architect-builder. When Petrie Senior died in 1872, he was succeeded by his son John Petrie. In 1880, A L Petrie joined his father to form the partnership John Petrie and Son, based at Fortitude Valley with branch masonry works at Toowong Cemetery and Townsville. In 1888, A L Petrie became general manager of the firm but was forced into insolvency in 1894. It was not until 1903 that he was able to re-open the monumental masonry business at Toowong Cemetery where many Queensland memorials were produced.\nIn the mid 1970s the memorial was vandalised. The surviving pieces of the statue were removed and put in storage at the RSL sub-branch at Childers. The statue was replaced by a concrete obelisk until a new digger was unveiled on 18 August 1999 by the Honourable Bruce Scott.\nThe reserve also contains a band rotunda in the vicinity of the memorial. This was built in 1911 for the Apple Tree Creek Citizens' Brass Band. It was in regular use for the first decades because many houses lined the creek at that time. By 1975 it had become derelict and underwent extensive repair and reconstruction in 1983. It is one of the few buildings remaining from the early settlement of the area and contributes to the aesthetic qualities of the park.\nThe First World War Memorial is situated facing the road in a landscaped area within the Apple Tree Creek sports ground which encompasses a cricket ground, rodeo ring and small band rotunda.\nThe memorial comprises a pedestal surmounted by a small concrete obelisk. It is surrounded by an octagonal enclosure of concrete kerbing with a decorative cast iron fence comprising thin pickets with fleur-de-lis finials. The posts are also cast iron and surmounted by Latin crosses. In front of the enclosure is a painted timber fence with a centrally placed cast iron gate.\nThe monument is of Helidon sandstone and sits on a granite base with rough stone faces, margined and chiselled around. Surmounting this are another two steps, both smooth-faced. The lower step has a chamfered top and the words Apple Tree Creek Roll of Honour carved in high relief on the front face. The upper step has plain faces and is capped by cyma recta mouldings.\nSurmounting this is the pedestal dado comprising a recessed square marble pillar with engaged columns at each corner. It has recessed marble plaques to each side recording the leaded names of the 77 local men who served in the First World War, the names of the fifteen who fell being on the front face.\nThe columns have capitals of scrollwork and acanthus leaves which support a large cornice made up of cyma recta and torus mouldings. Above this is a small square pedestal with crossed flags carved in relief on the front face and capped by a small cornice.

    "article": "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)\" is a popular song that was made famous by Glenn Miller and by the Andrews Sisters during World War II. Its lyrics are the words of two young lovers who pledge their fidelity while one of them is away serving in the war.\nOriginally titled \"Anywhere the Bluebird Goes\", the melody was written by Sam H. Stept as an updated version of the nineteenth-century English folk song \"Long, Long Ago\". Lew Brown and Charles Tobias wrote the lyrics and the song debuted in the 1939 Broadway musical Yokel Boy. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Brown and Tobias modified the lyrics to their current form, with the chorus ending with \"...'till I come marching home\".\nDon't Sit Under the Apple Tree\" remained in Your Hit Parade's first place from October 1942 through January 1943. It was the longest period for a war song to hold first place.\nIn February 18, 1942 the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires. This record spent thirteen weeks on the Billboard charts and was ranked as the nation's twelfth best-selling recording of the year. In May the song was featured in the film Private Buckaroo as a performance by the Andrews Sisters with the Harry James orchestra and featuring a tap dancing routine by The Jivin' Jacks and Jills. This scene is often considered one of the most memorable of the film. The Andrews Sisters then released the song on Decca Records. (In a 1971 interview, Patty Andrews reported that this was their most requested song.) Many other artists released records of the song that year, including Kay Kyser. With the Miller, Andrews, and Kyser records all being popular on the radio, \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\" became one of the few songs in history to have three different versions on the radio hit parade at the same time.\nThe following year, Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh wrote \"They Just Chopped Down the Old Apple Tree\" for the film Around the World as a humorous parody of this song, which was recorded by The Dinning Sisters. Frank Loesser's and Arthur Schwartz's \"They're Either Too Young or Too Old\" from Thank Your Lucky Stars, also references the song when a woman tells her lover that she \"can't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me\" because all of the other men her age are also fighting in the war. More recently, \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\" was featured in the films Twelve O'Clock High (1949), With a Song in My Heart (1952), Kiss Them for Me (1957), A Carol for Another Christmas (1964), In Dreams (1999) and The Master (2012). It also featured in the mini-series The Pacific, and an instrumental muzak version was featured in the film Devil (2010).\nThe title of the song was the inspiration for columnist Lewis Grizzard's 1981 book, Don't Sit Under The Grits Tree With Anyone Else But Me.\nIn 2012, Broadway icon Carol Channing released a duet of the song with Country singer T. Graham Brown on her album True To The Red, White, and Blue.\nThe title of the song was the inspiration behind Steven J. Andrews' debut novel, 'Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree'.",
